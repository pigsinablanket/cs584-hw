\subsection*{Solution}

We are given the actual costs of the three operations, push, pop, and isEmpty, each with cost 1.

We will define the enqueue operation an amortized cost of 4, and the dequeue operation an amortized cost of 1.

Enqueue a thing: 
costs 1 push, so has 3 credit
Dequeue a thing, nothing on stack 2:
  costs:
  1 isEmpty (regardless)
  1 pop from stack 1
  1 push to stack 2
  1 pop from stack 2

total cost is 4 for the operations, with dequeue paying for isEmpty itself, and the other 3 coming from the 3 credit left over from enqueue

Dequeue a thing, something on stack 2:
  costs:
  1 isEmpty (regardless)
  1 pop from stack 2
