\subsection*{Solution}

Under the assumption of uniform hashing, the likelihood for any insertion to have a colision is $n/m$ where $n$ is the number of probes is $m$ is the size. We know that our open-addressed table has $n < m/2$, so the load factor is known to be strictly $< 1/2$.

The probability of neding more than $k$ probes will be some value $(1/2)*(1/2)*...*(1/2)$ for $k$ times, or $(1/2)^k$. So $(n/m)^k < (1/2) ^k = 2^{-k}$.
