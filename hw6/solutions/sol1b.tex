\subsection*{Solution}

Under the assumption of uniform hashing, the likelihood for any insertion to have a colision is $n/m$ where $n$ is the number of probes is $m$ is the size. We know that our open-addressed table has $n < m/2$, so the load factor is known to be strictly $< 1/2$.

\begin{align*}
  2 lg n &== (1/2)^{(2 lg n)} \\
         &== 2^{(-2 lg n)} \\
         &== 1/{(2^{lg n})^2} \\
         &== 1/n^2 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore the probability of needing more than $2lg(n)$ probes will be $1/n^2$.
