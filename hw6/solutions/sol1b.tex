\subsection*{Solution}

Under the assumption of uniform hashing, the likelihood for any insertion to have a colision is $n/m$ where $n$ is the number of probes is $m$ is the size. We know that our open-addressed table has $n < m/2$, so the load factor is known to be strictly $< 1/2$. Similar to 1a, a probe that takes more than $2 \lg n$ probes means $(1/2) * (1/2) * ... * (1/2)$ for $2 \ln n$ times, or stated another way, $(1/2)^{2 \lg n}$ times.

\begin{align*}
(1/2)^{(2 \lg n)} &== 2^{(-2 \lg n)} \\
                 &== 1/{(2^{\lg n})^2} \\
                 &== 1/n^2 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore the probability of needing more than $2 \lg(n)$ probes will be $1/n^2$.
