\subsection*{Solution}

We can see that partition is polynomial time since summing $A$ and $A'$ can be both done in $O(n)$ and then comparing the sums together is constant time.

Recalling from SubsetSum, given a set $S$ of positive integers and a target integer $s(a)$, find a subset $A$ of $S$ that sums to $t$. If $s$ is the sum of member of $A$, then $X'=X \cup \{s - 2(s(a))\}$ where $s = \sum_{a \in A} x$.

Assume there exists some $S \subset A$ such that $t = \sum_{a \in A} a$.

\begin{align*}
  s - t &= \sum_{a \in A \cup {s-2s(a)}} a \\
        &= \sum_{a \in A \cup X' \setminus {s-2s(a)}} a \\
\end{align*}

Therefore $S \cup \{s - 2s(a)\}$ and $X' \setminus S \cup \{s - 2s(a)\}$ form a partition $A'$.

Suppose $A'$ is partitioned into $P_1'$ and $P_2'$, then there is a sublist $A$ that $\{s-2s(a)\} \in \sum_{a \in P_1'} a = \sum_{a \in P_2'} a$. Therefore, $\{s-2s(a)\} \notin \sum_{a \in P_1'} a = s(a)$. Since $P_1$ is in $A'$, all the numbers summed to $s(a)$ are in $A$. The SubsetSum is a known NP-Complete problem. Therefore, reducing this problem into partitioning shows that partitioning is NP-Complete.
