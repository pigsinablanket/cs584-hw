\subsection*{Solution}

Proof by contradiction

Assume we kept a heaviest edge that we knew was in a cycle. 
Any MST will not contain cycles, which means that we must have removed a less heavy edge to meet this requirement. This means that we kept a heavier edge when not necessary, so our MST is not minimum.
