\subsection*{Solution}

Assume for contradiction that their is a minimum spanning tree $T$ that contains $e$. We know that trees do not contain cycles and therefore there is some edge $e'$ in a cycle that is not in $T$. $e$ is the heaviest edge in the cycle, so $weight(e') < weight(e)$. If $e' /= e$, then we can swap e for e' and get a smaller mminimum spanning tree.
