\subsection*{Solution}

\begin{codebox}
\li sort the edges according to their weights \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  // $O(E \lg E)$
\li \For each edge $e \in E$, in decreasing order of $w_e$ \    // $O(E)$
    \Then
    \li \If $e$ is part of a cycle of $G$  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \    // $O(E)$ (from 2c)
        \Then
        \li $G = G - e$   \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \    // $O(1)$
        \End
    \End
\li \Return G
\end{codebox}

Because line 3 has complexity $O(E)$, and is in an inner loop that iterates over all of $E$, then it has overall time-complexity of $O(E^{2})$. The initial sort can be ignored because $O(E \lg E) \in O(E^{2})$
