\subsection*{Solution}

When you sort all the edges and traverse over the list in decreasing order by weight, detecting an edge that is part of a cycle will be the heaviest edge in that cycle since no other edges have been reached yet. The property states that the heaviest edge from the cycle is removed to get an MST, and the following MST algorithm also removes the heaviest edge from the cycle, leaving only the edges that are not part of a cycle in the end, either because they never were part of a cycle to begin with, or they were part of a cycle that was broken by removing a heavier edge.
