\subsection*{Solution}
An input on which Graham's Scan will perform significantly better than Jarvis March is when all the points are on the convex hull. When all the points are on the hull for Jarvis March, every point in the set must be compared with every point on the hull and when every point is on the hull, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$. For Graham's scan, the complexity of the sorting algorithm used is the complexity of Graham's scan therefore will always be $O(nlog n)$ no matter the input.
