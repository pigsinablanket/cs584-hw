\subsection*{Solution}
The maximum value will always be a peak. In this problem, the square matrix can be represented as a one dimensional array. The data is sorted and a maximum could be retrieved in constant time. Once the maximum is found, the index can be found in constant time by mapping the one-dimensional index back to two-dimensional. Since the sorting algorithm used is $O(n \log n)$ and the other operations are all in constant time, the overall complexity is $O(n \log n)$.

\begin{verbatim}
  2dPeakFinding(xs) {
    let m = square matrix dimension
    let sortedXs = mergeSort(xs)
    let max = max(sortedXs)
    return (indexOf(max) / m, indexOf(max) % m)  # (x,y)
}
\end{verbatim}
