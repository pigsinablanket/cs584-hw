\subsection*{Solution}

The following algorithm is the fastest we could determine:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Calculate every subset of the graph
  \item Remove subsets that contain restaurants on adjacent vertices
  \item Compute total profit for each remaining subset
  \item Take the max value from these subsets
\end{enumerate}

Further analysis shows that this problem is a form of the Maximum Independent Set problem, and thus is NP-Hard. Thus, there is no known polynomial-time solution.
