\subsection*{Solution}

The following algorithm is the fastest we could determine:

1) Calculate every subset of the graph
2) Remove subsets that contain restaurants on adjacent vertices
3) Compute total profit for each remaining subset
4) Take the max value from these subsets

Further analysis shows that this problem is a form of the Maximum Independent Set problem, and thus is NP-Hard. Thus, there is no known polynomial-time solution.
