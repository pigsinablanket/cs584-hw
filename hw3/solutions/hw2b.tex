\subsection*{Solution}

We devide the elements with a recursive call on 2/3 and add to the recursive call on the items larger than the pivot which is 2/3n.

t(n) <= an + T(n/3) + T(2/3 n)
     =  an sum(i=0, inf, (3/3)^i)
     =  an * n
     =  an^2
     =  e O(n^2)

Because we are recurrsing on the tree with n/3 and 2/3n, the combined recursion ends up looking at n total values.
