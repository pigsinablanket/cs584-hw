\subsection*{Solution}

We divide the elements with a recursive call on $n/7$. We are able to partition the groups with 4/7 items smaller than the pivot (this is $(1/2)*4*(n/7) == 4n/14$ groups), and groups with 4/7 items larger than the pivot (this is also $(1/2)*4*(n/7) == 4n/14$). These are the known elements we can eliminate, which leaves us with $5n/7$ elements to recurse on and further filter. 

\begin{align*}
T(n) &\leq an + T(\frac{n}{7}) + T(\frac{5n}{7}) \\
     &= an * \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \frac{6n}{7} \\
     &= an * \frac{1}{(1 - (\frac{6}{7}))} \\
     &= 7an \in O(n)
\end{align*}

With splitting into groups of 7, we get a lower constant but the overall performance is still $O(n)$
