\paragraph{Problem 1: Lower Bounds [10 points]}
Prove that any comparison-based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree from an arbitrary list of $n$ elements takes $\Omega(n \log n)$ time in the worst case. (Hint: Consider how to reduce the sorting problem to performing a set of operations on a binary search tree. In other words, show that if a faster algorithm existed for constructing a binary search tree then you would violate the $\Omega(n \log n)$ comparison-based sorting lower bound.)

\paragraph{Problem 2: Median of Medians}
The 'Median-of-medians' selection algorithm presented in class divides the input into groups of 5. Using a group of odd size helps keep things a little simpler (because otherwise the group medians are messier to define), but why the choice of 5?
\subparagraph{(a) [10 points]}
Show that the same argument for linear worst-case time complexity works if we use groups of size 7 instead.

\subparagraph{(b) [10 points]}
Show that groups of size 3 results in superlinear time complexity.
